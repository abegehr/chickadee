# üê¶ Chickadee

Chickadee is a self-managed, open-source website analytics tool running on a Cloudflare Worker.

Monorepo:

- `./packages/app` - the service: events endpoint, client script, and dashboard
- `./packages/web` - the landing page: <https://www.chickadee.me>

## Deploy your Own

1. Make sure you have installed the [Cloudflare Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) and authenticated with your Cloudflare account by calling `wrangler login`.
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/abegehr/chickadee` and `cd chickadee`.
3. Run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `pnpm app run deploy` to deploy the service to Cloudflare.
5. Make note of your worker URL: `https://<your-worker-name>.workers.dev`.
6. Set all secrets listed in the [Secrets](#secrets) section on you worker: `pnpm app wrangler secret put ‚Ä¶`.
7. Open your worker URL in your browser and login with username `admin` and password `BASIC_PASSWORD` configured in step 6.

<!-- TODO add cli for easier deployment -->
